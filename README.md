# This script is used to design a 2D planar robot arm with two joints that draws two unique capital letters at a constant speed.
# By deriving both forward and inverse kinematics equations to find end-effector velocities and accelerations and joint angular velocities and accelerations, the resulting MATLAB simulation shows the robot armâ€™s trajectory as it seamlessly draws the letters A and O.
